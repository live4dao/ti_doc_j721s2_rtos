SBL Overview
============

Introduction
------------

| This page provides an overview about the Secondary Bootloader support

| The Secondary Bootloader (SBL) sets-up the PLL clocks, powers on the
  I/O Peripherals, initializes the DDR, loads the application image into
  DDR & brings the slave cores for applicable SOCs out of reset.
  Additional details including execution boot flow is covered in more
  elaborate detail under individual SOC section.

.. rubric:: Boot Modes
   :name: boot-modes

.. rubric:: MMCSD
   :name: mmcsd

MMCSD bootloader is required to boot target using an SD card containing
bootloader and application images. When the board is powered ON the ROM
bootloader detects the MMCSD bootloader image and loads it to the
internal memory. The bootloader initializes the board, copies the
application image from SD card to the DDR memory and gives control to
the application.

.. rubric:: eMMC
   :name: emmc

eMMC bootloader is required to boot target using eMMC present on SOM containing
bootloader and application images. eMMC have three partitions i.e UDA, boot0 and
boot 1 you can copy images either to boot0 or UDA partition. When the board 
is powered ON the ROM bootloader detects the eMMC bootloader image and loads it to the
internal memory. The bootloader initializes the board, copies the
application image from eMMC to the DDR memory and gives control to
the application.

.. rubric:: OSPI
   :name: ospi

A flash device interfaced with OSPI is flashed with OSPI bootloader and
application images. When the board is powered ON the ROM bootloader
detects the bootloader image from flash device and loads it to the
internal memory. The Bootloader initializes the board, copies the
application image from OSPI device to the DDR memory and gives control
to the application.

.. rubric:: UART
   :name: uart

A Serial connection is used for transferring the bootloader binary from
PC to target board through XMODEM protocol. The bootloader on execution
prompts for application image to transfer through XMODEM. On providing
the path, the application binary is transferred through serial
connection to DDR memory and the control is passed to application to
execute.

.. rubric:: Common Steps to debug application boot
   :name: common-steps-to-debug-application-boot

Bootloading an application is a system level issue which is impacted by
hardware as well as software setup. There are some common steps that
users are expected to check while debugging boot related issues. This
section discusses common issues to checkout when debugging application
boot.

.. rubric:: Hardware Debug Steps
   :name: hardware-debug-steps

**Input clocks and power sequencing**

-  Ensure that correct power sequencing is occurring on your board.
   Power sequencing specifications can be found in the data manual.
-  Check the system clock and ensure this is outputting the expected
   frequency and the signal is swinging rail to rail (should be a 1.8V
   signal). If you have an external oscillator, it should be outputting
   a square wave at the desired frequency. If you are using a crystal ,
   you should have a sine wave at the desired frequency at XTALIN.
   XTALOUT should be similar (may be distorted a little).
-  Check the power on reset signal PORZ. This signal should stay low
   throughout the power sequencing and go high when the power AND high
   frequency clock are stable.
-  If the device has an OBSCLK or CLKOUT then ensure that this pin
   provides the correct output that matches your software
   configurations.

.. rubric:: **Boot pins:**
   :name: boot-pins

Best way to confirm what the device ROM bootloader reads from the pins
is to read the register where the Boot pins are latched into the device

.. rubric:: **Boot media connectivity**
   :name: boot-media-connectivity

Users are required to test their boot interface by running boot loader
independent diagnostic tests that confirm that the SOC can read and
write from the boot interface.

TI Technical documentation like Technical reference manual and Bootloader
Application notes list default behavior or the ROM
bootloader and limitations and constraints for each boot mode.
Application developers need to account for this while designing their
system to ensure smooth bring up process.

.. rubric:: **Signalling on boot media and reset pins**
   :name: signalling-on-boot-media-and-reset-pins

If software and other hardware debug steps have not helped identify the
issue, you may need to hook up a scope or protocol analyzer to check the
clocks and the data transfers from the boot media to check if there is
any issues that can be identified. Another commonly known issue that
impacts boot is noise on the power lines which may cause the SOC to
reset or cause a hang on the boot core. Provide these scope shots to TI
on E2E forums so TI engineers can confirm that there are no issues.

.. rubric:: Software Debug Steps
   :name: software-debug-steps

.. rubric:: SBL and app Entry points
   :name: sbl-and-app-entry-points

If you don`t see your bootloader executing post boot, a good sanity
check is for you to look at the map file for the bootloader and ensure
that the entry point matches with the location in the TI or GPHeader in
the boot image. this can be done by looking at the entry point in the
MLO/_ti.bin/GPheader and ensure that it matches with the location of
symbol Entry in the .out/map file for the bootloader.

.. rubric:: SBL and App memory map
   :name: sbl-and-app-memory-map

The SBL executes from device onchip memory so if your application is also
using Onchip memory in addition to DDR memory, developers need to ensure
that the code sections in the application do not overlap with memory
sections that are used by the SBL. This can cause the SBL to hang during
the application boot process and go into an abort state.

To check what memory region is used by the SBL please locate the map
file created from building the bootloader.

.. rubric:: Flash Programming verification
   :name: flash-programming-verification

It is essential to understand that the flash programmer that you use has
not just the ability to write the image to flash but should also be able
to verify that the image written to flash matches the image that you
have created on your host machine. You can use TI flash programming
utilities as reference and ensure that the production flashing tools use
a method to erase, write and then verify the boot image that is written
to the flash.

.. rubric:: DDR timings and configuration /SBL
   :name: ddr-timings-and-configuration-sbl

The bootloader ships with DDR clock and timing settings
that apply to the external memory devices that have been used in TI
evaluation platforms. When running the code on custom platforms, users
may be required to change these setting to match the timings required by
custom design. We highly recommend that users create a GEL script
similar to one provided by TI and test the memory interface with the new
settings before using them in the secondary bootloader to setup external
memory.
provides a mem_test that can be used to test read and writes to the
entire DDR address space for confirming the SOC EMIF settings.

.. rubric:: Emulator based debugging of boot
   :name: emulator-based-debugging-of-boot

The bootloader is like any other application that can
be loaded over the emulator and debugged. Steps to connect an emulator
to the EVM have been described in the hardware setup guides.

Loading the bootloader over emulator can be very useful step in
debugging the system boot. Before generating the final binary for
bootloader, the build generates the .out file for the bootloader which
is then formatted in a boot format that the ROM bootloader(RBL) can
interpret. This .out can be loaded over the emulator similar to any
other application. If you load the debug version of the bootloader, you
can single step through the code that initializes the SOC and also part
of the SBL code that loads the app from the boot media.

   style="margin: 5px; padding: 2px 10px; background-color: #ecffff; border-left: 5px solid #3399ff;">

**NOTE**
SBL runs from onchip memory so users can load the SBL.out even without
using the GEL file but using the GEL sometimes helps with putting the
core in a clean state so usage of the GEL is optional

**Alternate Approach:**

**Add a spinlock in SBL main**

In some occasions the RBL may load the SBL but there may be some issue
that you need to debug in the SBL. In this case you can add a spinlock
loop at the start of main in SBL and allow the first stage boot to
complete normally and then connect to the core when you connect the core
will be held in the spinlock condition waiting for you to connect.

Example:

::

    volatile int exitSpinLock = 0;
    void Debug_spinLock(void)
    {
        while (exitSpinLock == 0) { }
    }

You will then have to "release" the core by toggling the variable which
the while loop is blocking on. You can either do this manually by
halting CCS, examining the variable in the watch window and then
changing the value before continuing execution on the core, or you can
use a GEL script.

**Use an IO input to stall the core until user input is received:**

::

    printf("Hit enter to continue:");
    getchar();

.. rubric:: System state at boot failure
   :name: system-state-at-boot-failure

A useful data point for TI to debug boot related issues is to isolate
commonly known initialization and to understand how far the bootloader
has executed correctly before it runs into any issues. Users are
required to capture ARM/DSP clocks, Program counter value, Entry points
detected, pinmux configuration and confirm DDR initialization and slave
core states. This helps minimize the number of variables in the system
boot and helps us zero in on the most likely cause for the boot failure.
