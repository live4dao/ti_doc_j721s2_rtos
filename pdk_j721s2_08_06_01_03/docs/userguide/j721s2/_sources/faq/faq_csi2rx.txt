FAQ - CSI2RX
==================

What is CSI2?
------------------------

The CSI2:

- specification defines standard data transmission and control interfaces between transmitter and receiver.

- is unidirectional differential serial interface with data and clock signals; the physical layer of this interface is the MIPI Alliance Specification for D-PHY.

- also talks about 'The Control Interface (CCI)', and is a bi-directional control interface compatible with I2C standards.


How is Lane Speed Band selected?
---------------------------------------------------

The formula is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Required Bandwidth = (((Image Resolution) x bpp x fps x no. channels) x 1.2)
   Lane Speed = ((Required Bandwidth) / no. of lanes)

   bpp: bits per pixel
   fps: frames per second

   Select Lane Speed Band as following conditions:
   where (Lane Speed >= lower limit of the Lane Speed Band) and (Lane Speed < upper limit of the Lane Speed Band)

.. NOTE::

   Required Bandwidth have multiplication factor of '1.2 (corresponding to 20%)', this is done to absorb protocol and other overheads in the system


Things to consider/check before sending a frame over CSI2RX bus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure following is done/checked before attempting communication on bus:

- All the lanes are identical in the length (to be considered during EVM/Board design)
- Number of lanes, lane ordering, lane polarity, and lane speed configurations are matching at both ends i.e. transmitter and receiver side
- Receiver is configured and started before configuring and starting streaming from transmitter
- Configuration/Enable sequence:

  - CSI2RX Module (receiver)
  - Deserialzer (if any) (transmitter)
  - Serializer (if any)
  - Sensor/s OR Camera/s modules (transmitter)

- check if following connections are firm and proper:

  - CSI2RX to Deserialzer (if any) OR Sensor (e.g. EVM to Fusion board/Sensor)
  - Deserialzer to Serializer (if any) (e.g. Fusion board to Camera module through FPD cable)

- Channel configurations like frame dimensions (Height and Width), data-type (DT) and virtual channel (VC) are matching for transmitter and receiver
- Timing parameters configured at transmitter side meets the MIPI standards

  - check this if all the above parameters are checked and are properly configured
  - this needs to be measured on CSI protocol analyzer

CSI2RX communication failed, where to start debug?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check following before debugging for errors:
  - There 3 sets of status bit given for each lane in `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_DPHY_STATUS` register

    - For data reception check if this is toggling between '0x2' and '0x3' for each active data-lane and clock-lane

  - check if Stream and Protocol FSM are in proper states:

    - this can be done through `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_STREAM0_STATUS.bit0-1` and `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_STREAM0_STATUS.bit4-7`


Following section talks about various errors/conditions occurred during communication failure.

Errors detected during reception:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **Front FIFO Overflow**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Module Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit0`
  - Description: Overflow detected in resynchronization FIFO between DPHY Lane Management and Protocol blocks
  - This will occur if `sys_clk` is not fast enough and should be increased since the `byte clock` frequency is fixed

- **Payload CRC Error**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Packet Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit4`
  - Description: CRC Error has been detected while receiving payload data.
  - Asserted when the computed CRC code is different than the received CRC code.
  - This could happen due to interference OR mismatch configurations at Tx and Rx sides.

- **Header ECC Error**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Packet Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit5`
  - Description: Unrecoverable ECC error has been detected during short packet reception.
  - Asserted when an ECC signature was computed and the result is zero indicating a Packet Header that is considered to be without errors or has more than two bit-errors. CSI-2â€™s ECC mechanism cannot detect this type of error OR when an ECC signature was computed and two bit-errors are detected in the received Packet Header.
  - This could happen due to interference OR mismatch configurations at Tx and Rx sides.

- **Header Corrected ECC Error**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Packet Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit6`
  - Description: Recoverable ECC error has been detected during short packet reception.
  - Asserted when an ECC signature was computed and a single bit-error in the Packet Header was detected and corrected
  - This could happen due to interference OR mismatch configurations at Tx and Rx sides.

- **Data ID Error**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Packet Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit7`
  - Description: Data ID error has been detected in the header packet.
  - Asserted when a Packet Header is decoded with an unrecognized or unimplemented data ID.
  - This is caused by the presence of an unimplemented or unrecognized ID in the header.

- **Invalid Access**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Module Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit8`
  - Description: Invalid access to the configuration register space.
  - This could be caused by accessing reserved addresses within CSI2RX module registers.

- **Invalid Short Packet**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Protocol Decoding Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit9`
  - Description: A reserved or invalid short packet has been received

- **No Payload Long Packet**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Packet Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit10`
  - Description: No long packet has been received after receiving short packets for the payload start/stop.
  - Check the Transmitter configurations. Use the protocol analyzer to make sure that transmitter is sending data in correspondence with CSI2 protocol.

- **Truncated Long Packet**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Packet Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit11`
  - Description: Too many/too few bytes has been received during payload reception.
  - Check the Transmitter configurations. Use the protocol analyzer to make sure that transmitter is sending data in correspondence with CSI2 protocol.
  - This can caused by improper physical connections. Make sure that connections are proper and firm & free from any kind of interference.

- **Truncated Header**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Packet Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit12`
  - Description: A truncated (short OR long) header has been received.
  - Check the Transmitter configurations. Use the protocol analyzer to make sure that transmitter is sending data in correspondence with CSI2 protocol.
  - This can caused by improper physical connections. Make sure that connections are proper and firm & free from any kind of interference.

- **Stream FIFO Overflow**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: Stream Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_ERROR_IRQS.bit16-19`
  - Description: Stream FIFO overflow has been detected.
  - There is dedicated bit for each stream.

- **Start of Transmission Error (Error SoT)**

  - Detected at: CSI2RX Core
  - Level: DPHY Level Error
  - Register: `CSI_RX_IF_VBUS2APB_DPHY_ERR_STATUS_IRQ.bit8/12/16/20`
  - Description: Start of Transmission Error is detected on the respective data lane.
  - There is dedicated bit for each data lane.
  - There are two types of the errors for this category:

    - the high-speed SoT leader sequence is corrupted, but in such a way that proper synchronization can still be achieved, this error signal is asserted for one cycle of `RxByteClkHS`. This is considered to be a **soft error** in the leader sequence and confidence in the payload data is reduced.
    - the high-speed SoT leader sequence is corrupted in a way that proper synchronization cannot be expected, this error signal is asserted for one cycle of `RxByteClkHS`.

  - Check for the signal integrity and signals are getting properly transmitted w/o any issues/interference.
  - Check if timings are properly configured at transmitter and are adhering to CSI2 standards. These timings can be measured with the help of CSI2 protocol analyzer.
