Introduction
============

The Texas Instruments Platform Development Kit (PDK) is a single scalable software driver package that
offers streamlined development on TI's Processors. The PDK package contains device abstraction layer
libraries and peripheral/board level sample/demo examples that demonstrate the capabilities of the
peripherals for development, deployment and execution of applications.

The high level block diagram of PDK is shown in below figure.

Scope
=====

The purpose of this guide is to quickly provide the information you need most while evaluating and
developing applications on a TI embedded processor, specifically running embedded real-time operating system.
It is not intended to be a thorough design document. As such, the focus is on
application programming interfaces (API), build information, and examples to use as a template
to start development.
